Time will pass, and we\'ll be on our way.\n\
As the years go by there will be\n\
Happiest of memories\, rah rah rah!\n\
Stand and then we\'ll sing this song again.\n\
All you loyal men\nSing the praises of our order.\n\
Sing up you men of AZA\, up you men of AZA!\n\
\n\
Brothers we\'ll be as we share our cares each day,\n\
Happy and free though the years go on their way.\n\
Starting anew face to face with destiny,\n\
Hearts beating true for the friends and loves to be.\n\

So up, you men, and sing to AZA!\n\
Time will pass, and we\'ll be on our way.\n\

        We believe in AZA!\n\
        With voices loud we say we\'re proud of the A-Z-Aleph Tzadik Aleph.\n\
        We all know that Jewish life had its share of trouble and strife\,\n\
        But we\'ll never cease to work for peace in the AZ Aleph Tzadik Aleph.\n\
        \n\
        Brotherly love and charity\,\n\
        we cherish and promote harmony and democracy.\n\
        Jewish life will never stray\,\n\
        Bne\'i Brith is on its way\,\n\
        And it all began with Sam Bieber\'s plan for the AZ Aleph Tzadik Aleph.  </string>
