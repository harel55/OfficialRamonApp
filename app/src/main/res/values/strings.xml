Time will pass and we\'ll be on our way\nAs the years go by there will be\n\
Happiest of memories\, rah rah rah\n\
Stand and then we\'ll sing this song again\n\
All you loyal men\nSing the praises of our order\n\
Sing up you men of AZA\, up you men of AZA\n\
\n\
Brothers we\'ll be as we share our cares each day\n\
Happy and free though the years go on their way\n\
Starting anew face to face with destiny\n\
Hearts beating true for the friends and loves to be\n\
\n\
So up you men and sing to AZA\n\
Time will pass and we\'ll be on our way\n\
As the years go by there will be\n\
Happiest of memories\, rah rah rah\n\
Stand and then we\'ll sing this song again\n\
All you loyal men\n\
Sing the praises of our order\n\
Sing up, you men of AZA\, up you men of AZA</string>

        We believe in AZA\n\
        With voices loud we say we\'re proud of the AZ Aleph Tzadik Aleph.\n\
        We all know that Jewish life had its share of trouble and strife\,\n\
        but we\'ll never cease to work for peace in the AZ Aleph Tzadik Aleph.\n\
        \n\
        Brotherly love and charity\,\n\
        we cherish and promote harmony and democracy.\n\
        Jewish life will never stray\,\n\
        Bne\'i Brith is on its way\,\n\
        and it all began with Sam Bieber\'s plan for the AZ Aleph Tzadik Aleph.  </string>
    <string name="worldofazatext">In the time of AZA\n\
There lived a Jewish boy named Mordechai\n\
He was young and insecure\n\
He spent his Saturdays killing flies\n\
\n\
But there was this guy at school\n\
Who treated Mordechai with sympathy\n\
And he told him of a place\n\
He could be anything he wished to be\n\
\n\
We all live in the world of AZA, \'A\'!\n\
The world of AZA, \'Z\'!\n\
The world of AZA, \'A\'!\n\
We all live in the world of AZA, \'A\'!\n\
The world of AZA, \'Z\'!\n\
The world of AZA, \'A\'!\n\
\n\
At his first event that night\n\
He saw fraternity\n\
He saw the light\n\
He mailed in his check the next day\n\
Badadadabopbadopbadopbadadada\n\
\n\
We all live in the world of AZA, \'A\'!\n\
The world of AZA, \'Z\'!\n\
The world of AZA, \'A\'!\n\
We all live in the world of AZA, \'A\'!\n\
The world of AZA, \'Z\'!\n\
The world of AZA, \'A\'!\n\
\n\
Mordechai is now a man\n\
And his life no longer bland\n\
And he lives his every day\n\
With the power of AZA\n\
\n\
We all live in the world of AZA, \'A\'!\n\
The world of AZA, \'Z\'!\n\
The world of AZA, \'A\'!\n\
We all live in the world of AZA, \'A\'!\n\
The world of AZA, \'Z\'!\n\
The world of AZA, \'A\'!\n\</string>
